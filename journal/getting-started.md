# Getting Started

## Near-Death Experience

The way this mod's storyline starts out is a bit unorthodox. Each day, there is a very small chance that a [meteorite](lore/time-loop/meteorite.md) will land not too far from the player. This meteorite creates a small crater, and inside is the most important item in the mod: The [Causality Crystal](items-blocks-machines/unique items/causality-crystal/1.md). Upon right clicking the Causality Crystal, the item will enter the player's inventory and entries begin to accumulate in this journal.
