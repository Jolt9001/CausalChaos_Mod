Tungsten is a metal that has proven to be very challenging to refine and craft with due to its unique physical properties. The metal has a high melting point and is incredibly hard, which makes it difficult to process and find useful applications for, aside from crafting tools and weapons that are practically indestructible. Despite the challenging refinement process, I have managed to craft some exceptional tools using Tungsten which have proven to surpass Netherite in both mining speed and durability. However, I believe that there may be other methods to alleviate this issue and unlock the full potential of this extraordinary metal.
