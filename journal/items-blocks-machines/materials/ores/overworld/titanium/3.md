# Entry 3
I'm excited to share that I've successfully created Tungsten components using a Starforge that I built recently. These components are incredibly useful as they have exceptional blast resistance. In fact, I found that Tungsten is as good as Obsidian in terms of preventing explosions. However, what sets Tungsten apart is its versatility and ability to be used in a wide range of applications. Although it's more challenging to obtain than Obsidian, it's worth it due to its numerous benefits. With this breakthrough, I'm looking forward to experimenting with Tungsten and creating even stronger materials that can withstand harsh environments and extreme conditions.
