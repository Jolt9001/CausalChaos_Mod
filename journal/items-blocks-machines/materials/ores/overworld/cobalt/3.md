# Entry 3
Through some experimentation, I have recently discovered that Cobalt possesses an unparalleled level of enchantability. In fact, its enchantment retention capabilities and enchantment potential are even better than those of Gold. This is due to its inherent magical properties that allow it to enhance the already high level of magical power that Lapis Lazuli imparts on items. This combination breaks the limits on how powerful enchantments can become, resulting in Cobalt items with enchantments that are stronger than those of most other materials. Based on my current understanding, it appears that enchanted Cobalt items might even surpass the strength of those made using Netherite, which is widely considered to be one of the strongest materials. This makes Cobalt an incredibly valuable and sought-after material for creating powerful weapons, tools, and armor that can give me a significant advantage in combat and other challenging situations.
