# The Warden
<p>As I was delving into the depths of a dark cave in search of rare resources, I stumbled upon some unusual bluish-green growths. Intrigued by this discovery, I decided to investigate further, completely oblivious to the fact that I was treading on Sculk soil. Suddenly, a cacophony of ghostly shrieks echoed through the cave, and a formidable creature emerged from the ground. I have named this monster the Warden, as it appears to guard the area with its terrifying strength. Despite its intimidating appearance, I found that it's quite easy to summon. However, I soon realized that the Warden is blind and relies on its acute sense of hearing and smell to navigate, making it a formidable opponent.</p>
<p>Facing the Warden is a daunting task. This creature possesses immense strength, with the ability to unleash its melee attack every 0.9 seconds. Its mere touch can be fatal, capable of ending my life in a single blow if I don't have any armor to defend myself. However, what's truly terrifying is its ranged attack. When it's unable to reach its target, the Warden switches to a sound-based ranged attack that sends shivers down my spine. This attack may not be as potent as its melee counterpart, but it can bypass my shield and armor, along with any enchantments they possess. It's an attack that cannot be dodged without the use of my dash ability, which makes me especially grateful to have it at my disposal.</p>
<p>I'm relieved that the warden doesn't linger around for too long. From my experience, if I can avoid being detected by it, it will typically retreat and burrow back into the ground after approximately a minute. Fortunately, it's relatively straightforward to avoid its detection since the key is to keep a low profile and stay silent, particularly when I'm near the Shriekers. As long as I maintain a low profile and don't draw any unwanted attention to myself, I should be able to evade the warden's watchful gaze and safely continue with my adventure.</p>
