If I hold the Causality Crystal, I can perform a quick dash that allows me to seemingly warp forward a few meters. This technique is quite effective when it comes to covering long distances in a short amount of time, and I think it would be wise to make use of it as frequently as possible from this point forward. So, whenever I need to move quickly, I will make sure to execute a dash.
