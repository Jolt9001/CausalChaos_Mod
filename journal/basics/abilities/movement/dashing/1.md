### Dash for the first time.

<p>If I hold the Causality Crystal, I can perform a quick dash that allows me to seemingly warp forward a few meters. This technique is quite effective when it comes to covering long distances in a short amount of time, and I think it would be wise to make use of it as frequently as possible from this point forward. So, whenever I need to move quickly, I will make sure to execute a dash.</p>

<b><i> Conclusion: To move quickly over a short distance, you can execute a dash by pressing the [R] key. This move will propel you forward for about five blocks. </b></i>
