### Execute a dash in a direction other than forward.
As I continue to use the dashing technique, I have noticed that it has become much easier for me to execute. Although its range is still limited, it allows me to move far more quickly than I could while simply sprinting, and it works in any direction. However, I must remain cautious of my hunger levels, as performing this maneuver requires a significant amount of stamina. Despite this, I find myself relying on this technique more and more as I seek to improve my speed and agility.

<b><i>Conclusion: If you hold down a movement key and dash, you will move in the direction that the movement key is pointing. This means that you can control the direction of your dash by holding down the corresponding movement key.</b></i>
