### Encounter a Drowned with a Trident
During my recent expedition, I faced a daunting challenge when I encountered a group of Drowned in an underwater ruin. These aquatic undead were not only difficult to deal with, but their trident attacks were surprisingly quick and inflicted a great deal of pain. Despite my best efforts, I found it challenging to avoid their swift strikes and had to rely on my wits and combat skills to survive the encounter.
