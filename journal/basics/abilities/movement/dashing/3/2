When I explored the Ocean Monuments, I found that dealing with the Guardians was a real challenge. Not only do they have the ability to shoot a laser beam from their eyes, which can quickly drain my health if I'm not careful, but they also possess a natural defense mechanism in the form of Thorns that makes it difficult to deal damage to them without taking some in return. This means that I have to be extra cautious and strategic in my approach when facing these formidable foes.
