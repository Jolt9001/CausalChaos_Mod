As I reflect on my recent experience exploring underwater, it's become clear to me that I'll need to be extra cautious in future expeditions. While I had expected some level of exertion and potential danger, the reality of the situation surpassed my expectations. The constant exertion required to move through the water, coupled with the ever-present danger of encountering unexpected obstacles or wildlife, made for an experience that was both physically and mentally draining. All in all, I have a newfound respect for the complexity and unpredictability of underwater exploration, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this exciting field.
