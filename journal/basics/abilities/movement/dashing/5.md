### Dash while flying.
After I had perfected my agility and speed on the ground, I decided to take my training to the next level and learn how to fly. Once I had learned to fly, I quickly realized that my dash ability was much more powerful in the air than it had ever been on the ground. This newfound power allowed me to travel faster and cover greater distances with ease. One of the reasons why my dash was so much more effective in the air was due to the absence of friction from the ground, which meant that I could use my stamina much more efficiently. Flying was a truly exhilarating experience, and mastering my dash ability in the air was a major milestone in my training.

<b><i>Conclusion: The air dash is much more powerful than a grounded dash, with increased speed and double the range.</b></i>
