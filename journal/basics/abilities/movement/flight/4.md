### Take damage from flying into a wall while using enhanced Elytra Flight.
<p>As I soared through the skies, reveling in the freedom of flight, I couldn't help but feel a surge of confidence. In the midst of my exhilaration, I spotted a distant wall and decided to put my newfound flying skills to the test. With the wind in my face and the world rushing past me, I aimed directly for the wall, eager to showcase my flying prowess. However, my confidence was short-lived. In a spectacular display of overestimation, I failed to account for the fact that I was hurtling headfirst into solid terrain. The result? A comically abrupt collision that left me seeing stars and nursing a few bruises. Lesson learned: While the skies are yours to conquer, it's essential to maintain spatial awareness. Flying headfirst into a wall, no matter how tempting, is not the grand display of skill I imagined. My ego may have taken a hit, but at least my sense of humor remains intact.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: When soaring through the air using Elytra Flight, always keep an eye out for obstacles. The skies are vast, but a momentary lapse in judgment can lead to a less-than-dignified encounter with solid ground. Fly wisely!</i></b>
