# Powerful Attack: Evoker Fangs
### Get chomped by an Evoker's fang-summoning attack.
<p>As far as my observations go, I've noticed that the magic-wielding Evokers possess some intriguing abilities. Among their many attacks, one in particular stands out - the ability to summon armor-piercing fangs from the ground. This attack is capable of inflicting six points of damage and can be summoned in two different ways - either as a close-range attack directly surrounding it or as a 16-block line directed towards their target, which is often me. It's an impressive display of magical prowess, but also quite dangerous for anything that happens to be in its path.</p>
