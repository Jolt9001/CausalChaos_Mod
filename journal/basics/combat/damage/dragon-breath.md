# Powerful Attack: Dragonâ€™s Breath
### Take damage from the Ender Dragon's breath attack.
<p>While fighting the Ender Dragon, I couldn't help but notice how deadly its breath was. It's one of the few attacks I've seen that deals damage over time, the other being potion effects. The Dragon's Breath fireballs, while intimidating at first, are thankfully pretty easy to dodge. Even if I do get hit, the effect clouds left behind can be easily escaped. However, these clouds can also be used to create lingering potions and tipped arrows, making them a valuable resource. I should make a habit of scooping some up in bottles so I could maybe use them later, even if I risk getting hurt.</p>
