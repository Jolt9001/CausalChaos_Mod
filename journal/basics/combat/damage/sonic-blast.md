# Powerful Attack: Sonic Blast
### Get hit by a Warden's Sonic Blast.
<p>The Wardens summoned by Sculk Shriekers in the Deep Dark are a force to be reckoned with. Their ranged attack is a nightmare for any adventurer, as it has the ability to pierce through armor and inflict substantial damage. Given their formidable strength, it is essential for me to exercise utmost caution while exploring the depths.</p>
