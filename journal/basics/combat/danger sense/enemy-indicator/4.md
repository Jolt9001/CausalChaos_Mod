# Excerpt 4
### Dodge an attack that triggers or will trigger a hitbox to appear.
<p>I've noticed that my Danger Sense ability has some limitations. While I can sense powerful enemies around me, I can't see their attack range unless I've already seen one of their attacks before. However, I can still make use of the information provided by this ability to dodge attacks that I haven't seen before, although it might be challenging to execute successfully.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: The enemy indicator displays the location of powerful adversaries, but their attack range or hitboxes remain hidden until they are encountered. Once an attack has been experienced, its hitbox becomes visible.</i></b>
