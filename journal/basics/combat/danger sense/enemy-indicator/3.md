### Detect a hitbox.
<p>After some close calls in combat, I've started paying more attention to my Danger Sense ability. I've noticed that when an enemy is about to unleash a powerful attack that I've experienced before, I can see the area of effect as an ethereal red box suspended in space. This visual indicator gives me a split-second to react and trigger my Chronal Acceleration ability. With lightning-fast reflexes, I can dash out of harm's way and unleash a devastating counter-attack on anything in my path. It's amazing how a little extra awareness can make such a big difference in battle.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: When facing enemies, it's important to keep an eye out for the red hitboxes that appear during their attacks. These hitboxes indicate the exact area where the attack will land and deal damage.</i></b>
