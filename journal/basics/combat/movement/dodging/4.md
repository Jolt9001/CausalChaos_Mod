# Excerpt 4
### Get dodged and lose a battle against a powerful opponent.
<p>During my battle experience, I encountered an opponent who was extremely agile and quick. This adversary was easily able to dodge my strong attacks, which rendered my Chronal Acceleration useless. I found myself in a situation where I had very little time to anticipate and avoid incoming attacks. Faced with such a formidable opponent, I ultimately made the difficult decision to retreat from the battle. While I was able to survive the encounter, my heart was pounding in my chest, and I was shaken by the close call.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: It's important to note that some of your adversaries may have the ability to dodge your attacks. In such cases, you might receive a debuff called Chronal Deceleration. This debuff will enhance your perception speed but hinder your movement speed.</i></b>
