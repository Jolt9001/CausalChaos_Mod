### Execute a perfect dodge with the assistance of Danger Sense five times.
<p>Upon conducting several experiments, I have come to the conclusion that powerful attacks such as Creeper or TNT explosions trigger my danger sense. I have observed that standing within the effective range of an attack like this and dodging at the last second allows me to dramatically increase my movement speed, granting me a brief moment to make a swift counterattack. Moreover, I have discovered that using the Causality Crystal enhances my perception speed, making time appear to slow down significantly. This has aided me in reacting more quickly to enemies and avoiding their attacks with ease.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: Making use of Danger Sense can make it easier to avoid powerful attacks such as Creeper explosions or TNT blasts.</i></b>
