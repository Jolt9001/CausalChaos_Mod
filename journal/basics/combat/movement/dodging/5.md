# Excerpt 5
### Counter a flurry rush by dodging.
<p>Continuing the previous encounter with the enemy, I took a moment to gather my courage and plan my next move. As I faced the adversary again, I noticed that it was quick to dodge my attacks and follow up with a rapid chain of strikes. This sequence of strikes was highly unpredictable and difficult to anticipate, but still time-consuming enough to be detected. However, I didn't let this knowledge demotivate me. Instead, I focused on improving my dodging skills and timing, so that I could avoid the chain of attacks and leave the enemy with no chance to strike back. Eventually, my tactics paid off, and I was able to avoid the situation I encountered previously. It was a moment of triumph - I had finally outsmarted my opponent.</p>
<b><i>Conclusion: If you manage to trigger a perfect dodge when you are under the Chronal Deceleration debuff, it will cancel out the effect of the debuff.</i></b>
